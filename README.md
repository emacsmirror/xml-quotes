# Emacs XML Quotations

Emacs XML Quotations is a set of macros for generating quotations at
the end of email messages. At least, that's what I use it for.
Integration with Gnus and BBDB is provided. Hopefully the “API”
exposed to extract quotations is general enough to integrate into
other tools.

* xml-quotes.el, functions for reading the XML Quotations file.
* mail-signature-quotes.el, functions for adding quotations to the end of email messages.
* quotations.rnc, a RELAX NG grammar for the quotations document.
* .quotes.xml, a sample quotations file.

Share and enjoy.
